          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            My journey in web development started with a deep curiosity for
            technology, and over time, Iâ€™ve built several projects that solve
            real-world problems. I constantly strive to learn new technologies
            and improve my skills to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web
            industry.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I love crafting visually appealing and highly functional web
          applications that provide a seamless user experience.
          </p>
